# Scavenge Game Silly Mode
A localization file for the game called "Scavenge Game" by Orsoniks. It's been (partially) mutilated beyond recognition.

# DISCLAIMER
This is NOT a serious translation for the game! This was a project made for fun, and it is NOT recommended to have your first playthroughs of Scav Game be with this language file!

Also only a demo. There are over one thousand lines for dialogue, so... yeah, I am not doing that. Not yet.
